[.lead]
Within Microsoft Exchange Online, you can restore granular-level items for a single user, such as individual emails, tasks, contacts, and calendar events. You can also restore granular-level items for a Microsoft 365 group mailbox.

By default, only the most recent backup is available for restore.  You can update your backup settings to maintain a specified number of backed-up versions of individual files.  If you have more versions of a file than you have specified for backup, only the number of versions that you have specified is available for restore.

If you export to PST, you will receive a notification email with the location of the PST file when the export is completed.  Note: This option is not available for Microsoft 365 Groups.

* *Export* (Available for Microsoft 365 groups only):

If you export, a PST file is created with your Microsoft Exchange files and a .zip file is created in your Microsoft SharePoint sites.  You will receive a notification email containing the location of the PST file and an authenticated URL to the location of the .zip file.
