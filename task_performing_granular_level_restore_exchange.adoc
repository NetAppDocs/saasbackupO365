Within Microsoft Exchange Online, you can restore granular-level items for a single user, such as individual emails, tasks, contacts, and calendar events. You can also restore granular-level items for a Microsoft Office 365 group mailbox.

By default, only the most recent backup is available for restore.  You can update your backup settings to maintain a specified number of backed-up versions of individual files.  If you have more versions of a file than you have specified for backup, only the number of versions that you have specified is available for restore.
