Getting started with NetApp SaaS Backup (formerly named "NetApp Cloud Control) for Office 365 includes various steps such as deciding what type of storage you want to use to back up your data, gathering pertinent information, creating a MS Office 365 service account, and assigning user permissions.

toc::[]

== Deciding what type of storage to use to back up your data
NetApp SaaS Backup for Office 365 Control provides Amazon S3 storage and Azure Blob storage as options for backup.  SaaS Backup for Office 365 also enables you to Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) to back up your data. If you choose to use storage provided by SaaS Backup, you do not need to gather any information before signing up.  If you choose the BYOS option, you must gather pertinent information about your storage before signing up.

== Gathering information about your SaaS Backup for Office 365 storage platform
You need the following information to set up your BYOS Amazon S3 storage, StorageGRID Webscale object storage, or Azure Blob storage.

- Amazon S3
If you are using the Amazon S3 bucket provided by SaaS Backup, you do not need to gather this information.  If you are using your own Amazon S3 bucket, you must gather the following information:

  * Bucket name
  * Region
  * Access key
  * Secret key

- StorageGRID Webscale
SaaS Backup does not create the StorageGRID Webscale bucket.  It must already exist.

  * Host/IP address
    You must have a public IP address and a domain name with a certificate, for example, webscale.netapp.com. You must also be using Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol 1.2.
  * Port
    The open port should be 8082 or 443, whichever is configured.
  * Bucket name
  * Access key
  * Secret key

- Azure Blob

 * Account name
 * Container name
 * Access point
 * Access key

== Creating a new MS Office 365 service account with global administrator permissions
Creating a new Microsoft Office 365 service account with global administrator permissions is recommended when signing up for SaaS Backup for Office 365. However, creating a new account is not required.  If you prefer, you can use your existing Microsoft Office 365 service account.

.Steps

. Log in to your Office 365 Management portal using an account with administrative privileges.
. Click *Users*.
  image:users.jpg[Screenshot of users icon]
. Select *Active users*, and then click *Add a user*.
 image:O365_AdminCenter.jpg[Screenshot of Office 365 Admin Center]
. Enter the details of the new service account.
 * First name
 * Last name
 * Display name
 * User name
   The user name is the name of the service account.
   image:new_user.jpg[Screenshot of new user form]
. Expand *Roles*, select *Global administrator* as the role, and then click *Add*.
 image:roles.jpg[Screenshot of available administrator roles in Office 365]
 The service account details are sent to the administrator.
. Log in to your Office 365 Management Portal with the new account to activate it.
. Ensure that the service account includes licenses for Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, at a minimum.
+
This is especially important if you restrict the individual licenses for the Global administrator role.

== Assigning user permissions to your MS Office 365 service account
Before you sign up for SaaS Backup, you must assign user permissions to your Microsoft Office 365 service account.  The process you follow to assign user permissions depends on the Microsoft services (Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business) you are using with SaaS Backup.

=== Assigning user permissions for  Microsoft Exchange online
If you plan to use SaaS Backup with Microsoft Exchange Online, you must configure impersonation.  Impersonation allows your Microsoft Office 365 service account to impersonate user accounts and access associated permissions.

To automatically configure impersonation, run https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn722376(v=exchg.150).aspx[MSDN PowerShell Commands].

To manually configure impersonation:

.Steps

. Use Exchange Admin Center or an administrator account to log in to your Microsoft Office 365 service account.
. Select the *Exchange* tab.
. In the left navigation pane, under Dashboard, select *Permissions*.
. Click *Admin roles*.
. Double-click in the right pane to select *Discovery management*.
. Under *Roles*, click the *+* symbol.
  image:write_scope.jpg[]
. Select *ApplicationImpersonation* from the drop-down menu.
. Click *Add*.
.	Click *OK*.
.	Verify that *ApplicationImpersonation* was added under *Roles*.
.	Under Members, click the *+* symbol.
  image:members.jpg[]
  A new window appears
. Choose the user name.
. Click *Add*.
.	Click *OK*.
. Verify that the user name appears in the *Members* section.
.	Click *Save*.

=== Assigning user permissions for Microsoft OneDrive for Business
If you plan to use SaaS Backup with Microsoft OneDrive for Business, you must assign eDiscovery permissions.  This allows your Microsoft Office 365 service account to access the site.

NOTE:  After you add eDiscovery permissions, your service account is listed as an owner of all backed-up site collections. This does not change permissions or grant access that was not previously authorized.

You can assign user permissions manually or automatically.  If you have a few users, manual assignment is recommended.

*To manually assign permissions to each user account:*

.Steps

. Under the *Admin* tab, select *SharePoint*.
.	Click *User profiles*.
.	Under *People*, select *Manage User Profiles*.
.	Search for the users that you want to configure.
.	Scroll over the search results, and then select the down arrow for the user that you want to select.
.	Select *Manage Site Collection Owners*.
.	Under *Site Collection Owners*, add the appropriate administrator account.
.	Click *OK*.
.	To verify the permissions, select the down arrow and then select *Manage Personal Site*.
  The Microsoft Office 365 service account can now access the site.

*To automatically assign permissions to each user account:*

.Steps

.	Run the https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assign-eDiscovery-permissions-to-OneDrive-for-Business-sites-422858ff-917b-46d4-9e5b-3397f60eee4d[SharePoint Online Management Shell script].
. Log in to the Office 365 Management portal with your Microsoft Office 365 service account.
  Your Microsoft Office 365 account should have global administrator permissions.
.	In the left navigation pane, click *Admin centers > SharePoint*.
.	Click *user profiles*.
.	Under *My Site Settings*, click *Set up My Sites*.
.	Under *My Site Secondary Admin*, click *Enable My Site secondary admin*.
.	In the *Secondary admin* field, type the name of your Microsoft Office 365 service account.
.	Click *OK*.

=== Assigning user permissions for Microsoft SharePoint Online
If you plan to use SaaS Backup with Microsoft SharePoint Online, you must https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-administrators-for-a-site-collection-9a7e46f9-3fc4-4297-955a-82cb292a5be0#__toc341786267[add an administrator to the site collection administrator list].

== Performing an immediate backup of a specific backup policy
When you set up Saas Backup for Office 365, by default, all of your data is unprotected.

You can perform an immediate backup any time you deem necessary for data protection. If you are running a trial version of SaaS Backup for Office 365, you can only perform three immediate backups per day, per service.

.Steps

.	From the Dashboard, select the service for which you want to perform an immediate backup.
.	Under *Backup Policies*, click the tier that you want to back up.
.	Click Backup Now.

.	Click *Confirm*.
  A message is displayed indicating that the backup job was created.
