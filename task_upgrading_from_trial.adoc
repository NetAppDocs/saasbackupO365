When you upgrade from a trial subscription to a licensed subscription, your trial data is only preserved if you keep the same backup storage destination type and the same backup storage region. To associate the license to the correct tenant account when you upgrade, use the same email address for both trial and licensed subscriptions.

*If you change your backup storage destination type, your trial data is lost.  Any change to your backup destination region also results in data loss.*
