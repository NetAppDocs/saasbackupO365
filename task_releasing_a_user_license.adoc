Any regular user mailbox, whether protected or unprotected, consumes a license.  If a license is no longer needed for a particular user, you can release the license so that it can be reassigned.  When a user license is released, the user is moved to the unprotected tier and backups for that user are discontinued.

*Note:* Share mailboxes do not consume a license.
