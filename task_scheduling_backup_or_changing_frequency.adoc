You can back up your unprotected data by assigning it to a backup policy. When unprotected data is assigned to a backup policy, it moves to a *PENDING* state until the next scheduled backup for the assigned policy occurs, after which it is moved to a *PROTECTED* state.
If you want to change the backup frequency of protected data, you can assign the data to a different backup policy tier.

.Steps

1. From the Dashboard, click the number above *PROTECTED* or *UNPROTECTED* in the box of the service you want to change.
  If you want to change the backup frequency of protected data, click *PROTECTED*. If you want to backup newly discovered mailboxes, sites, or MySites, select *UNPROTECTED*.
