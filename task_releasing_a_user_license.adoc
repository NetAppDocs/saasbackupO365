Any regular user mailbox, whether protected or unprotected, consumes a license.  If a license is no longer needed for a particular user, you can release the license so that it can be reassigned.  When a user license is released, the user is moved to the unprotected tier and backups for that user are discontinued.

NOTE: Share mailboxes do not consume a license.

.Steps

. Click the configuration icon image:configure_icon.gif[Screenshot of configuration icon] next to your SaaS Backup user id in the top left corner.

. Click *RETAIN AND PURGE*.
. Under *Release License*, begin typing the account name for the user whose license you want to release.

. Add additional accounts, if needed.
. Click *Release*.
. Click *Yes, please release license(s)*.
. Click *Confirm*.

NOTE: If you need to restore data for a user whose license has been released, you must contact the SaaS Backup Support team.
