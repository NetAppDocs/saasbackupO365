=== Assigning user permissions for Microsoft OneDrive for Business
If you plan to use SaaS Backup with Microsoft OneDrive for Business, you must assign eDiscovery permissions.  This allows your Microsoft Office 365 service account to access the site.

NOTE:  After you add eDiscovery permissions, your service account is listed as an owner of all backed-up site collections. This does not change permissions or grant access that was not previously authorized.

You can assign user permissions manually or automatically.  If you have a few users, manual assignment is recommended.

*To manually assign permissions to each user account:*

.Steps

. Under the *Admin* tab, select *SharePoint*.
.	Click *User profiles*.
.	Under *People*, select *Manage User Profiles*.
.	Search for the users that you want to configure.
.	Scroll over the search results, and then select the down arrow for the user that you want to select.
.	Select *Manage Site Collection Owners*.
.	Under *Site Collection Owners*, add the appropriate administrator account.
.	Click *OK*.
.	To verify the permissions, select the down arrow and then select *Manage Personal Site*.
  The Microsoft Office 365 service account can now access the site.
