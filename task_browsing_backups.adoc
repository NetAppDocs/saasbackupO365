You can browse protected instances in recent backups or in all of your backups for Microsoft Office 365 Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and Groups.

NOTE: The default browse setting is *Showing Last 5 days Backup*. If you select 5 days, only items backed up in the last 5 days appear. You can change the time range as needed.

To be sure you find what you are looking for, check the date to the left of the time range dropdown menu.

NOTE: *View Backup History* shows a calendar view of your backups. If you select *View Backup History*, and you select a date prior to the current day, this changes the time range for the backups you see. For example, if today is 8 October, you select 5 October in the calendar view, then you select to browse the last 5 days starting from 5 October, the items you can browse will be from 1-5 October.


. Click on the type of items you wish to view: Mail, Calendar, Tasks, Contacts, Files, Contents, or other.
. Browse the backed up items.
