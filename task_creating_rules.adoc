Rules allow you to automatically move users to a preselected backup tier based on predefined criteria.

You can create rules for Microsoft Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint Online, and Microsoft Office 365 Groups.

You must apply a user defined filter to your data before you can create a rule.  Applied filters are displayed below the *Filter* icon.  NetApp SaaS Backup for Microsoft 365 default filters appear in gray.  User defined filters appear in light blue.
