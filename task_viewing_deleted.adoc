You can view deleted items from SharePoint services at any time by switching on *Show deleted items* in Service Settings. This helps you save time; instead of browsing through different backups for deleted items, turn on the switch to find the deleted items immediately.

We recommend turning off the switch when you've found what you're looking for.

.Steps

.	Click *SERVICES* on the left navigation pane.
. Click the Settings icon image:settings_icon.gif[Image shows the settings icon].
