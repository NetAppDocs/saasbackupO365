To prepare for the end of your license with SaaS Backup for Microsoft 365, you can request data migration to tenant-owned Amazon Web Services S3 or Azure Blob.

After data migration completes, you can export your data using the SaaS Backup Export Utility tool. Sign in to link:mysupportnetapp.com[NetApp Support]. Then visit link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools[the NetApp Support Tools page] and search for SaaS Backup Export Utility.

NOTE: Data migration is an end-of-license activity. All tenants should avoid any form of activity on their SaaS Backup accounts to avoid data and metadata discrepancy during data migration. After data migration completes, all scheduled backups for the tenant will be disabled.

*Requirement*: To request data migration, you must have global tenant permissions. Other user roles will not be able to access the Data Migration tab in the user interface.

*Recommendation*: You should provision the destination storage with sufficient capacity to store all customer data and add 10% more capacity as a buffer for metadata storage.

.Steps
. Go to *Account Settings* image:gear_icon.png[gear icon].
. Select the *Data Migration* tab.
. In *Storage Details*, enter information into the fields:

TIP: You will need the tenant ID when you export your data using the SaaS Backup Export Utility tool.
