=== April 2018
* SaaS Backup for Office 365 now supports shared mailboxes for Microsoft Office Exchange Online.

If your service for Microsoft Office Exchange Online is already activated, you must grant SaaS Backup permission to create the automatic service account, so that your shared mailboxes can be discovered and backed up.  <<task_managing_services.adoc#granting-permissions-to-enable-shared-mailboxes,Granting permissions to enable shared mailboxes>>

  After your automatic service account is created, your shared mailboxes will be automatically discovered during the next scheduled synchronization of your user account.  If you want your shared mailboxes discovered immediately, you can   <<task_managing_services.adoc#synchronizing-user-accounts-sites-and-groups,synchronizing your user accounts immediately>>.
