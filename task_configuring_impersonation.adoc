If you plan to use SaaS Backup with Microsoft Exchange Online, you must configure impersonation.  Impersonation allows your Microsoft 365 service account to impersonate user accounts and access associated permissions.

== Automatically configure impersonation
To automatically configure impersonation, run https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn722376(v=exchg.150).aspx[MSDN PowerShell Commands].

== Manually configure impersonation
You can manually configure impersonation with your Microsoft 365 administrator account as well as with added Microsoft 365 service accounts in SaaS Backup. For more information about Microsoft 365 service accounts, go to link:task_creating_msservice_account_with_global_permissions.html[creating a Microsoft 365 service account with global permissions.]
