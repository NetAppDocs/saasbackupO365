 The service account details are sent to the administrator.

. Log in to your Microsoft 365 Management Portal with the new account to activate it.
. After signup, ensure this service account maintains three permissions:

*  Exchange Administrator
* SharePoint Administrator
* Application Impersonation Role
+
This is especially important if you restrict the individual licenses for the Global administrator role.

== ZZZ Config account
As part of your SaaS Backup subscription, a new account is created with ZZZ CC Config [GUID].

This auto-created account is used for discovering Shared/Archive mailboxes and private groups. It should have Exchange and SharePoint permissions (customized administrator in O365). It is recommended that you exclude this account from MFA policies.

To avoid any discovery or backup failures, leave the account as is.

== Create additional service accounts
Service Accounts can be added in SaaS Backup for Microsoft Office 365 to improve the backup performance for a customer. A service account is a Microsoft Office 365 user account without a license; it is used for backup and restore operations.

This type of account requires 3 permissions:

*	Exchange administrator
*	SharePoint administrator
*	Application impersonation role

To add an additional service account, the service account must already exist in your Microsoft Office 365 environment. If you do not have an existing account, then create one.

TIP: To optimize performance, it is recommended that you have 1 service account added per 1000 users in Office 365.
