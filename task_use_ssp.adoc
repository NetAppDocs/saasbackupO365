You can use Self Service Portal (SSP) to find and restore items for Microsoft Exchange Online.

Requirements:
* *Advanced Search* must be enabled for the tenant.
*	A full backup is required for indexing mailbox items.

== Enable Self Service Portal
To enable Self Service Portal for individual Exchange Online tenant account holders, administrators must first enable *Advanced Search*. Go to link:task_using_advanced_search.html[Use Advanced Search] to enable *Advanced Search*.

After *Advanced Search* is enabled, you can enable the Self Service Portal setting by updating your Exchange Online backup settings.

To restore items, you should complete a full backup before you update your Exchange Online backup settings. This ensures you can find the items to restore.
