Creating a new Microsoft Office 365 service account with global administrator permissions is recommended when signing up for SaaS Backup for Office 365. However, creating a new account is not required.  If you prefer, you can use your existing Microsoft Office 365 service account.

.Steps

 The service account details are sent to the administrator.
. Log in to your Office 365 Management Portal with the new account to activate it.
. Ensure that the service account includes licenses for Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, at a minimum.

This is especially important if you restrict the individual licenses for the Global administrator role.
+
NOTE: You can enable multi-factor authorization (MFA) on this account.

== ZZZ Config account
As part of your SaaS Backup subscription, a new account is created with ZZZ CC Config [GUID].

This auto-created account is used for discovering Shared/Archive mailboxes and private groups. It should have Exchange and SharePoint permissions (customized administrator in O365). It is recommended that you exclude this account from MFA policies.
