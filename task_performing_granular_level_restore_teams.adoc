Within Microsoft 365 Groups and Teams, you can restore granular-level items like mailboxes, SharePoint, conversations, channels, tabs, and attachments.

By default, only the most recent backup is available for restore.  You can update your backup settings to maintain a specified number of backed-up versions of individual files.  If you have more versions of a file than you have specified for backup, only the number of versions that you have specified is available for restore.

The table indicates the restore options that are supported for granular-level items and where to find them in SaaS Backup.
