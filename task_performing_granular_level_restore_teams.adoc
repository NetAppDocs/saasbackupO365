Within Microsoft Office 365 Groups/Teams, you can restore granular-level items like mailboxes, SharePoint, conversations, channels, tabs, and attachments.

By default, only the most recent backup is available for restore.  You can update your backup settings to maintain a specified number of backed-up versions of individual files.  If you have more versions of a file than you have specified for backup, only the number of versions that you have specified is available for restore.

* Restore to the same site
+
If you restore to the same site, by default, a restore folder with the current date and time stamp is created in the original file location containing the backup copy.  If you select the *Overwrite with merge* option, no restore folder is created.  If the version of the backup file and the current file match, the backup is restored to the original location.  Any new content in the destination is ignored and unaffected.  For example, if the backup contains File1 version5 and the destination contains File1 version 6, a restore with the *Overwrite with Merge* option selected fails.  If you select the *Replace the existing content* option, the current version of the data is completely replaced with the backup copy.
