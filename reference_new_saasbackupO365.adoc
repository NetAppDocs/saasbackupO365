== New features and updates
The following new features and updates have been added to this release of NetApp SaaS Backup for Office 365

=== May 2018
* NetApp Cloud Control has been renamed to NetApp SaaS Backup for Office 365.
* You can now purge users, site collections, and Office 365 groups, completely removing all associated data from SaaS Backup for Office 365.
  <<task_managing_services.adoc#purging-a-user-site-collection-or-office-365-group,Purging a user, site collection, or Office 365 group>>
* SaaS Backup now discovers both public and private groups for Office 365 groups.

=== April 2018
* SaaS Backup for Office 365 now supports shared mailboxes for Microsoft Office Exchange Online.
  Shared mailboxes are discovered through the use of an automatically created service account.  If you have not activated service for Microsoft Office Exchange Online prior to this update, the automatic service account for shared mailboxes is created by SaaS Backup when you activate Microsoft Office Exchange Online. If your service for Microsoft Office Exchange Online is already activated, you must grant SaaS Backup permission to create the automatic service account, so that your shared mailboxes can be discovered and backed up.  <<task_managing_services.adoc#granting-permissions-to-enable-shared-mailboxes,Granting permissions to enable shared mailboxes>>

  After your automatic service account is created, your shared mailboxes will be automatically discovered during the next scheduled synchronization of your user account.  If you want your shared mailboxes discovered immediately, you can   <<task_managing_services.adoc#synchronizing-user-accounts-sites-and-groups,synchronizing your user accounts immediately>>.

=== March 2018

=== October 2017
* Rules can be created that allow you to automatically move users to a preselected backup tier based on predefined criteria.

== Known problems and limitations
* Partially failed job status for restore of site collection group
  If an entire site collection group is deleted, the restore of private groups in the collection fails, resulting in a restore job status of “partially failed.”  If this happens, the site is not accessible from the GUI.
